- **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript types between frontend and backend

### Data Model

#### Agents
- Core entity representing AI agents
- Properties: name, description, systemPrompt, tools, capabilities, source, status
- Source types: built-in, user-created, community
- Status types: active, inactive, testing, archived

#### Tasks
- Execution instances of agent workflows
- Properties: title, description, status, agentIds, workflow, progress
- Status types: pending, running, completed, failed, cancelled

#### Templates
- Pre-configured agent blueprints
- Properties: name, description, category, agentConfig, rating, downloads

#### Messages
- Chat messages for task execution
- Properties: taskId, agentId, role (user/agent/system), content

### Design System
- **Primary Color**: Purple (262 83% 58%) - used for CTAs and active states
- **Color Scheme**: Dark mode optimized with light mode support
- **Typography**: Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for code
- **Component Patterns**: Card-based layouts, consistent spacing, elevation on hover
- **Interactions**: Subtle animations, loading states, error handling
